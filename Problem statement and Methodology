Problem statement:

Initial State:
There is no prediction of revenue for the Sales team at a customer level. The type of forecast should vary from ttype of the cusotmer
The sales people do not know if they will reach their goals or not because they do not know how their customers will perform and ocntribute to their revenue stream

Desired Final State:
1) There are forecasts for each of the customer among different categories of the cusotmers
2) the forecasts are compared against the goals which are produced for each sales employee. 
Later if the sales employee gets to know that he/she will not meet the goal numbers via the predictions, he takes better decisions via the 3 Power BI app built for them

Questions:
1) Which platform and process (Black box or transperant) should be followed for th eprediciton/ time series modelling? 
What are the internal and external factors to include for predicting the Revenue, Number of bookings?
2) What is the metric to determine the predictions of Revenue?
3) How can the data be segmented to create meaningful insights?

Approach:
Followed the 6 stage framework of CRISP Data Mining process

Business understanding:

1) Business travel contributes $1.18 trillion to the global economy 
2) Business Travel and Expenditures is often the second highest controllable annual expense for a company
3) Predicting the Revenue, Number of bookings will help the company to allocate the resources more efficiently

Data understanding

1) The data is a longitudinal. It has the Transaction ID, month, year, date of booking, # of tickets booked, Region of booking, GDP of the booking region
2) The dataset consists of ~50000 instances ranging across 4 years

Data Preperation:

1) Identied external factors which will be useful for the predictions gauging it across Relevance and Accessibility from majority voting method
2) Aggregated the Revenue, Number of bookings data at a Year, Quarter, Month, Region level
3) I have added external factors like Monthly global production of crude steel, U.S. Gross Output


Mdelling:
I have used Box Jenkins standard approach for time series forecasting
1) Determine stationarity and seasonality
	a. Stationary should show constant mean and scale of deviation
	b. Seasonality could be seen from ACF and domain knowledge
2) If non-stationary, use first-differences âˆ‡ to achieve stationarity
3) Identify p and q of ARMA(p, q)
	a. Use ACF, PACF, EACF as above
4) Estimate model parameters
	a. Use Arima or auto.arima
5) Check the model fit
	a. Residuals
6) Forecasting 

Have built Holts winters Seasonal and Seasonal ARIMA models. Nested predictions was used. Predictions of the initial months was considered for the preictions of the later months
Have created a R Shiny application to predict the targets variables

Clustering - I have implemented time series hierarchial clustering to identify groups of customers in the data which behave similarly.
There were significant insights about the customers in eawch cluster

Evaluation:
1) Have used the metric RMSEto evaluate the difference of Actual and predicted revenues
2) Baseline model which was created was the mean of the Revenue at the level of data analysis. Post which the above mentioned evaluation metrics were applied for comparison

Deployment (Next Steps):
1) The R shiny application can be used by deploying the same in the Travel Management company. Multiple users can access if its on a cloud sharing platform like AWS or R server
2) It can also be automated so that on a monthly basis when the data changes, the predictions can be produced and used. We can connect the model to the platform from where the data is stored

Learnings:
1) R shiny interactive features - Reactive, selectinput, renderplot
2) Addition of external factors into the clients dataset and use it for the further analysis
